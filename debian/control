Description: per-core/NUMA CPU and disk utilization plain-text grapher
 This is a top-of-the-line logger of CPU usage patterns, designed for
 machines with a lot of cores, up to ~140 total hardware threads on an 80
 column terminal, more if your terminal is not minimal.  Every per-tick
 sample is shown abusing Unicode characters to fit within a single line.
 .
 Disk usage is also shown in a similarly terse per-device way, as %
 utilization for reads and writes.

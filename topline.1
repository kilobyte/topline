.SH DESCRIPTION
While programs like \fBhtop\fR can show per-core loads, they do so
interactively.  There are loggers like \fBdstat\fR but, using numeric
data, they have no chance to fit per-CPU information within a line on
modern many-core processors.  Thus, \fBtopline\fR uses Unicode graphing
symbols to squash the data into a terse, two-hyperthreads-per-char, form.
This allows eyeballing NUMA separation, CPU hopping, etc.
.P
Once per second, \fBtopline\fR plots stats for that interval:
.TP
per every disk,
one character with two columns of dots gives that disk's utilization time
percentage.  The left column shows reads, the right one shows writes.  Disks
are grouped into parenthesised groups by interface type (NVMe, SATA, eMMC,
\&...).
.TP
per every non-hyperthreaded CPU or a pair of hyperthreaded siblings,
a character with one or two columns is given.  Non-HT CPUS are drawn with
bars, HT ones with dots, offline cores are marked with 'o'.  The parentheses
group CPUs by their NUMA node.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I <program> <arg1> <arg2> ...
Runs a program and terminates the graph once the program exits.  The graph
still exhibits the global state of the system rather than just the program
you chose and its children.
.P
If no program is given, \fBtopline\fR will keep logging forever (ie, until
you press ^C or similar).
.TP
.BR -l ", " --line-output ", " --linearize
Marshalls the program's output line-by-line, avoiding mix-ups with
\fBtopline\fR's data.  They will be interspersed in separate lines.
.br
The program will know it is being piped; if you want it to believe it's ran
on a terminal (to get colors, etc) you may use a tool like \fBpipetty\fR.
.TP
.BI "-i " <interval>
Sets the interval between data samples; the default is 1s.  Floating-point
values are allowed; the number may be suffixed by a "s" (seconds, default),
"m" (minutes), "h" (hours), "d" (days), "ms" (milliseconds), "us" or "Âµs"
(microseconds).
.TP
.BI "-o " <file> "\fR," " " --output " <file>
Redirects \fBtopline\fR's output to the given file.  The program being ran
can then use stdout and stderr unimpeded.
.SH CAVEATS
If the machine's CPUs are hyperthreaded with more than one or two per core,
the graph won't make it obvious which columns share a core.  All siblings
are still given consecutively, unless forced into separate NUMA nodes with
fakenuma settings.
.P
Machines above 140-150 CPUs may not fit on an 80-column terminal.
.P
All utilization figures are \fBglobal\fR to the machine even if causes by
something else than the program you run.
